							<h2>Bio</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my site and trying to get to know me a little better! I was born into a military family while my father was stations overseas, and spent the first third of my life raised in Europe. Due to my upbringing as a military brat, I was naturally drawn to civil service after graduating college as a way to continue the amazing experiences I had growing up around those that served. After nearly 10 years I can proudly say it was the right choice!
						<p>Now I've approached a new state in my life, and have come to a crossroads where I can see myself either continuing with federal service, or branching out to something new. There are so many subjects that interest me!
						<p>Outside of the federal sector: I have a deep interest in sustaining the planet and the technologies that allow us to do so. I have an interest in helping the less fortunate and their communities by means of my engineering expertise. I have an interest in real estate, and real estate investing and enjoy hunting for deals and performing value analysis.
						<p>Inside the federal sector: I continue to have a deep interest in avionics, and supporting a military platform, especially from a sustainment perspective. I enjoy real-time work that provides results that I can see and experience. I enjoy interacting with stakeholders, understanding their experiences and helping them receive the capabilities they need.
						</p>
